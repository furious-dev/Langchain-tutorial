    "In this notebook, we will build a simple LLM (Large Language Model) Agent that tackles logical reasoning questions using only Python. Through this process, you will gain insight into the **Agentic framework**, with a specific focus on one of the most widely used agentsâ€”**ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** agents. By the end of this notebook, you will have successfully created a ReAct Agent from scratch using Python, while also developing a foundational understanding of how agents function. This knowledge will serve as a stepping stone toward mastering more advanced agentic concepts such as **Autonomous Agents**, **Large Multimodal Agents**, and more."
